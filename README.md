# python-api-challenge
For Module 6 Challenge:
This challenge involves using my knowledge of Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to investigate what the weather is like as we approach the equator.

Part 1: WeatherPy:
A Python script is used to visualise the weather over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
The citipy Python library Links and the OpenWeatherMap API Links are used to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Part 2: VacationPy:
A vacation is planned using the geoViews Python library and the Geoapify API. Map visualisations are created.
